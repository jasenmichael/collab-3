  <h4>Linux and Open Source</h4>
  <p>
    When I advise others who are considering switching to Linux, I speak mostly to the immediate benefits of using the stack: increased security, all of your software gets updated in one place, decreased boot times, and so forth. Yet, the most important reason
    for switching to an open source stack is grounded in ethics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Choosing open source software isn’t just good for your security — it is also the most ethical option. How can running open source software be the right choice out of all the computing options? After all, it
    wasn’t like people would live or die based on whether they put in the Windows, MacOS, or Linux install CD. However, after several conversations and a few more years,
  </p>
    I believe that choosing open source software is the most ethical option for one primary reason...
  <p>
    <b>The benefit to the wider community that comes with knowledge sharing and collaboration.</b>
